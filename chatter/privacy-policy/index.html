CHATTER PRIVACY POLICY 2024

Chatter, a product of [wholeworldcoding], is available as a simplistic alternative to popular social media applications. The application is in fact based on a web app hosted on the site glitch.me (please see that privacy policy as well). All data is stored via that site, and we will not use it in any dangerous way.
