        <h1>THE FUTURE OF EXPLOITS</h1>
        <h6>[wholeworldcoding]</h6>
        <hr id="hrstyle"></hr>
        <p>I'm sure everyone's familiar with the exploits related to the apps that administrators provide. These allows users (in deprecated versions of ChromeOS) to access a fully uncensored browser with no restrictions. Why? Because of how obvious it is how these exploits work. Google is allowing users who don't have a guest mode to, in a way, have a guest mode. Those apps are, in reality, just websites running in an isolated fullscreen version of ChromeOS. This is confirmed in Bypassi's recent breakthrough. What this found was that behind every "kiosk app" is actually an isolated instance of a chrome browser. Therefore, we can determine that the easiest way to rid ourselves from blocking extensions is through kiosk apps. This is fair with previous exploits such as SC0PEx that depended on an iframe url which links to github, which then accesses the site of your choice. Bypassi's exploit is legit just that on sterroids, and it also confirms my assumption. Unfortunately, TestNav (the exploitable kiosk app) has since patched it and even added a built-in tool to prevent it, a GoGuardian of sorts built-in. Therefore, the easiest way to encounter a new form of exploit is simple: explore the kiosk apps more. And, just so you know, I'm not against Google, GoGuardian or ChromeOS. In fact, when they block things, I applaud them. I just enjoy experimenting and finding out exploits. It's fun! I suggest you do as well. In one final note, I recently found a new exploit: <a href="https://wholeworldcoding.com/crocus">CROCUSx</a>. Go ahead and try it out!</p>
